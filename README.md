CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization

This was the final project of CS 330: Computational Graphic and Visualization. It consists of a 3D scene rendered based off of a 2D image; this project shows a pie on a plate, with a mug and a cup.

Designing software is about creating modular, clean, functional code. In my work on this project, I focused on meeting one requirement at a time. There were many aspects that needed to be worked on in this 3D scene, from lighting and camera controls to simple and complex object rendering. Focusing on one element at a time allowed me to maintain focus and efforts on single tasks instead of spreading myself thin across an entire project. Once I was comfortable with one aspect of the program, the next requirement became the goal. This translates well into other development projects, where separating my duties between the many tasks I will need to accomplish will improve both focus and quality in the overall product.

Computer science helps me achieve my goals by training critical thinking and problem solving skills. It expands my logical reasoning; a lot of this course was looking at existing code, understanding what it was doing, and then either adding to or changing the code blocks. This will benefit future careers as I now have considerable experience with reasoning my way through code segments to understand logic.
